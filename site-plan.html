        The Teeth, but for dogs program is a program that revolves around the puppy enhancement standards that our modern-day, beauty-eccentric society revolves around. We aim to provide bright, shiny smiles to canines of all shapes and sizes, as long as those dogs also meet Teeth, but for Dogs beauty standards. We aim to bring high quality, professional care to the owner and to the pup, so that all are left with bright grins at the treatments of Teeth, but for dogs. Teeth, but for Dogs implants are purely cosmetical enhancements that exist solely for the purpose of increasing the quality of life for dogs that would otherwise be shunned for their ugliness. Dogs that previously had little to give to the world can now feel comfortable, less self-conscious and confident knowing that they contribute shiny, pearly-white smiles to the world.

      <h3>Personal and Community Impact</h3>
      <p>
        We highly recommend that every dog be given the opportunity to be able to try out the fulfilling lifestyle that comes with Teeth, but for dogs enhancements. The benefits aren't purely related to our caring canines though, our policies are both great for the consumer and the community. The personal care we demonstrate is beautifully shown by our many policies. Our return policy is sure to fit your precious pooch's needs, with a 30 day free trial you can give your pooch all of the physical-cosmetic enhancements that you desire, completely free of any payment. We want you to know that your dog is satisfied with the results of our work, and see that pearly-white smile for itself. Our community care is also shown by the way that we take care of our own. All of our teeth are locally, and naturally sourced, meaning that you benefit your community by purchasing Teeth, but for dogs. We also promise to return the teeth taken from any humans with our Toothfairy contract, should you wish to return them at any time. That way pearly white smiles stay circulating the community for years to come. With all of these benefits and more both to your dog and to the communities around us Teeth, but for Dogs is sure to leave everyone grinning happily for many years to come. Teeth, but for Dogs cosmetic implants do come with a cautionary piece of advice: These cosmetic enhancements will be ruined if they come in contact with dog food, human food, or anything that could be remotely considered 'food' of some kind. These teeth are actually made from a compound called "Beautinol". Beautinol reacts violently with most carbon based molecules, meaning feeding your perfect pooch will of necessity follow a more structured regime following your canine companion's cosmetic surgery. A feeding tube (not provided) would enable your four-legged fido to continue a liquid diet, or you could just aim to feed your perfect pup really well prior to the surgery. We recommend that all owners of our dogs take the time to stock their dogs up on new liquid treats so that they can leave their smiles untarnished, and their pooches happier than ever.
